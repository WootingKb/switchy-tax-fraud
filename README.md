# Switchy Commits Tax Fraud

This game was made in around 8 hours for people to have a fun time and win prizes at Computex and other events we at Wooting are attending! Due to the nature of the narrow "it needs to work at the event and nowhere else" nature of this repository, some things may not work properly. You can play it at home, but don't expect an intuitive experience (this doesn't work on Firefox, for example).

This repository is made available for learning, tinkering, and inspiration.
We welcome forks and personal experimentation, but some restrictions apply. You can read more about the terms of use for this codebase in the [License](LICENSE.md) and [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) files.
